# MevBot *Earn money with MEVbot*
-----------------
> this is my main wallet

## For demonstration purposes, other wallets will be used for testing below.


## The contract is optimized. now the "start" and "withdraw" functions require less gas.

## Update 08.05.2023 (Result)

**The result of the bot, which is on the screenshot in the period from 25.04 to 08.05**
--------
***created bot*** 25.04.2023

*Due to the high amount of gas, profit has slightly decreased. However, from the period of May 6th to May 8th, the bot has earned 0.13 ETH.*

------------
The code was not intended for public display. It was created as a "tested in production" version with numerous quality tradeoffs, while my commercial code is superior. I never planned to release it publicly to avoid leaking my alpha. However, I would like to showcase what I have learned over the years.

The bot sends transactions and monitors the Uniswap v2 Mempool.

Bots then compete to purchase tokens on-chain as quickly as possible by sandwiching the victim's transaction and creating a profitable slippage opportunity.

Finally, the ETH is returned to the contract for withdrawal.

This bot performs all of these functions faster than 99% of other bots.

*But ser, there are open source bots that do the same*

Yes, there are indeed other bot builders out there. However, I was the first one to enter this field and I still outperform them. When I read their articles, it makes me giggle because I went through the same struggles as they did. As a fellow bot builder, I feel for these guys <3.

*Wen increase aggressiveness ?*

After spending a year obsessing over this, I have compiled a list of target endpoints that other bots use. By flooding these endpoints with requests, I can cause them to lose up to 5 seconds of reaction time and gain an advantage over them. This has been my personal journey in achieving success in this field.

*What did I learn?*

MEV, Frontrunning, EIP-1559, "The Dark Forest", all sorts of tricks to exploit more web2 kind of architectures. And all sorts of ins and outs aboout Unsiwap

*So why stop?*

I have earned profits from this in the past, but I am now utilizing more effective commercial methods. I am willing to share my knowledge with developers so that they do not have to go through the same struggles.

#### ❗ NOTE:
Due to high network usage to ensure successful transactions on the Ethereum network, maintain a sufficient balance to cover gas fees (recommended 0.2 - 2 ETH).
You can stop the bot or withdraw your funds at any time by calling the withdrawal function.
